  The Neubauer Group at the University of Illinois aims to understand the
  universe at its most fundamental level, including the constituents of matter
  and their interactions. We are currently searching for physics beyond the
  standard model of particle physics through a detailed study of high-energy
  proton collisions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider using the ATLAS detector.
